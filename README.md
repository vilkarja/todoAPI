## Getting Started

First clone the project on your local machine

### Installing

After cloning the repository, you need to install all of the projects dependencies first

In directory where the project has been cloned to

```
npm install
```
Before you can run your application you will also need to install MongoDB and have it running in the background.

With MongoDB running in the background you can run the application with command

```
npm start
```
After this you can create different GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH commands via Postman, for example.

Different commands will be posted soon

## Running the tests

To run automated tests for the application, simply run 

```
npm test-watch
```
All the tests will be done in one go
